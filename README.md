Welcome to notes-101!
Here I was given the front end and was tasked to create the backend and conect it to the front end.

Here is my link to Heroku: https://shrouded-basin-02158.herokuapp.com/
    When I uploaded to Heroku I ran into no issues on my Terminal, however when I opened it on Heroku it kept throwing an error. this prompted me to run "Heroku logs --tail", after I ran this I was greated with "Error R10 (Boot timeout). I was not able to find the reason behind this. I am still currently trying to find this issue.

    I ran into may errors on my server. The first was that I kept getting a "405 Error (Method Not Allowed)". Upon research this is because either the ethod is known by the server but not supported by the target resourse. This also occuered with my DELETE.
